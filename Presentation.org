** =git= is a *Distributed* Concurrent Versions System
** GitHub is a *Centralized* =git= host
* Can we do without Github™?
*** Betteridge's law

Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Any headline that ends in a question mark  
can be answered by the word no.
#+END_QUOTE

. . .

Here the answer is *YES*!

- Linux (only mail)
- GHC used a self hosted instance of phabricator + trac
- many others I don't know

*** All right, we can, but /should we/?

** GitHub™
*** GitHub™: Social Network

  - user management & trust
  - discoverability

*** GitHub™: its free!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you're not paying for it,  
you're the product being sold.
#+END_QUOTE

$$: Pay for private repositories

*** GitHub™: Features!!!

From their website (in that order):

  - /Code Review/: comment diffs, approve, refuse, etc...
  - /Project Management/: issues, milestones, dashboard, etc...
  - /Integrations/: travis, slack, etc...
  - /Team Management/: access rights, community guidelines, etc...
  - /Social Coding/: follow, explore, share, etc...
  - /Documentation/: github pages, wiki, ...à
  - /Code Hosting/: all your code in one place, tree view, blame view, etc...

*** GitHub™: Metas

Most GitHub™ features put data in their own internal closed representation:

- Issues
- Comments
- Pages
- Pull Request & review
- Wiki

Note there are tools to export them.
Ex: migrate to Gitlab

*** GitHub™ is great today but can suck tomorrow

- /bloatware/
  remember digg, readitlater?
- /downgradeware/
  Swagger-UI v3 (v2 is neat), reddit new redesign (looks better, but slow)
- /payware/
  You rely on our feature, but now, we want you to move or to pay. Fair ;)
- /crapware/
  Nothing works as expected unless you pay: Twitter streaming API?
- /dieware/
  Remember Friendfeed? Google Reader™?
- etc...

*** GitHub™ force all your team member to use GitHub™

Were you already forced to:

- use PowerPoint? Excel? Word?
- code in PHP? in Java?
- work on windows? Harder need to ssh to UNIX machines?
- use Eclipse instead of vim/emacs?
- use a super complex GUI instead of a few command line tools?
- etc...


*REAL STORY @WORK*: github dashboard is slow & terrible for the manager.

*** Why you shouldn't rely too much on GitHub™?

- Github™ is great to get you started:
  - nothing to install
  - only high level interface
  - everything explained with nice docs
  - github is really a great product
- *The hidden price to pay*:
  - use closed source services
  - give freely many private infos
  - you must TRUST github for privacy, private account

*** Why not self hosted Gitlab then?

Gitlab is a better alternative but:

- You still keep the metas of your project in the Gitlab server in some DB.
- You still force all the member of your team to use your Gitlab version, with
  your Gitlab plugins, with your Gitlab settings, etc...
- Gitlab push a big warn so you are pushed to upgrade (new features & anti-features)

*** =git clone=

- [X] code

- [ ] *issues*
- [ ] *reviews*
- [ ] *comments*
- [ ] *wiki/doc*
- [ ] *hooks*
- [ ] *web pages*

* Git Project Manager
*** Problems

- can't clone everything
- big dependence on private tooling (that could change or being interrupted)
- force same tooling choices accross your team members

*** Solution

- put metas in git branches
  *CLONE ALL THE THINGS!!!!*
. . .
- use text files for everything
  *DO NOT FORCE ANY TOOL*
. . .
- only rely on conventions, better on standardized conventions
  *HELP TO WRITE SPECIFIC OPEN SOURCE TOOLS*

*** Git Project Manager =gpm=

- command line tool
- integrate your project management metas in your git repo
- automate a few common tasks
- follow a few conventions


/Tool freedom/

- people on the team don't need to install or use =gpm=
- they just need to follow a minimal set of conventions
- want to use other conventions? Write yourself a =gpm= in a few hours.
- but really there are /very few/ conventions =gpm= follows

*** =gpm= conventions

- =git= as DCSV
- text files
- Project Management metas goes in the branch =gpm=

*** Encouraged but not enforced =gpm= conventions

- encourage to use =org-mode= format but you can change
- issues goes in =issues.org= file
- reviews goes in =reviews/= with name =<branch>-<reviewer>.org=
- docs goes in =wiki.org=
- serve goes in your XDG data dir (standard)

*** git is already batteries included

- =git= hooks
- =git instaweb=
- =git daemon=

* Conclusion
** Decentralized Web
*** Decentralized Authentication: IndieAuth

- one of your online identities = one domaine name
- serve a page with all your online identity providers and username
  - google
  - twitter
  - etc...
  - but also your GPG keys (see keybase)

Mainly you OWN & CONTROLE your identity and the informations about it.

*** Decentralized Comments: Webmention

- you host your comment
- a 3rd party website can decide to show it in its comment section

*** Dentralized Web

- Your content is yours (prevent site death, change it, delete it...)
- Better connection:
  - messages can go to all your services
  - use open standards
- You are in control
  - post anything, any format, no monitoring, share links.
